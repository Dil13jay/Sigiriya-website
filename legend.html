    <h1>Legends of Sigiriya</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Sigiriya isn’t just an ancient rock fortress — it’s a symbol of mystery, ambition, betrayal, and even romance. Over the centuries, stories passed down through generations have made Sigiriya a place of legends. While historical records reveal much, what lies between fact and folklore makes Sigiriya truly magical.
    </p>

    <h2>The Lion Throne</h2>
    <p>
      At the summit of Sigiriya lies a flattened rock where King Kashyapa's throne is believed to have stood. According to legend, this was not just any throne — it symbolized his dominance over both men and gods. The entire palace was centered around this majestic lion-shaped gateway that once led to the very heart of his kingdom.
    </p>

    <h2>Kashyapa’s Pleasure Palace</h2>
    <p>
      Many legends describe Sigiriya not just as a fortress but also as a **"pleasure palace"**. Kashyapa, portrayed in some tales as a playboy king, is said to have filled his palace with music, dancers, fountains, and art. The famous frescoes of celestial maidens are believed to depict his harem or divine courtiers.
    </p>

    <h2>The Mirror Wall Love Poems</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most romantic legends comes from the Mirror Wall. Visitors who came to Sigiriya centuries ago carved poems and love notes into the highly polished wall — some expressing admiration for the king, others for the women in the frescoes. These inscriptions offer rare insight into ancient emotions and culture.
    </p>

    <div class="legend-box">
      <strong>“I am Budal. Came with hundreds of people to see Sigiriya. Since all the others wrote poems, I did not!”</strong>  
      <br><em>– 8th Century Graffiti</em>
    </div>

    <h2>Alternative Theories</h2>
    <p>
      Some believe Sigiriya was never meant to be a fortress or palace. Instead, they say it was a **spiritual retreat** or a **symbolic cosmic mountain**, designed according to Buddhist cosmology. Others say it was built by King Dhatusena, and Kashyapa only continued his father's vision.
    </p>
